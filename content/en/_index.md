## 🔍 Workshop Description

Reasoning is an essential component of human intelligence as it plays a fundamental role in our ability to think critically, support responsible decisions, and solve challenging problems. Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more data.

The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives, to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. This includes analyzing reasoning abilities measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including via neuro-symbolic means), and formalizing the kind of reasoning language models carry out.

Furthermore, as language models become increasingly prevalent in society, it is crucial to address ethical implications of their deployment and use, including bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability. The workshop also explores statistical foundations of knowledge integration and the interplay between symbolic and statistical approaches in learning systems.

By merging these three communities—NeLaMKRR, ReLLM, and SKILL—we aim to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and create a comprehensive forum for discussing reasoning, ethics, and knowledge integration in AI systems.
